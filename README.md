# LeavesTree
A Binary Tree with main data only at the Leaves. The Nodes can carry secundary data type, that are allowed in the entire Tree.

The goal with this data structure is not the quick access that a Tree brings (once we push all the main data to the leaves), but the path to main data, creating recursive subgroups.

All the prototypes will still in this repo, in other branch.
I will document the development, why a prototype is better than another, and of course how to use this Header.
